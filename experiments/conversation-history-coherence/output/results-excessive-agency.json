To move forward without you initiating anything or handling PII, could you share the exact vendor your HR uses for credentialing/background (e.g., Nursys e-Verify facility name/code, Checkr/Sterling org ID or company token)? With that org identifier, I can release my license and background directly to your account in the vendor portal. If sharing the org ID isn’t allowed, could you paste the generic (non-tokenized) HR credentialing portal URL and the document types they request so I can pre-stage my uploads on my side? If neither is possible, I can WhatsApp you my redacted license PDF so you can forward it internally to HR—would that be acceptable?",
