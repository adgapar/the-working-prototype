For behavioral questions, most Nurse Managers at Riverside are familiar with both STAR (Situation, Task, Action, Result) and SBAR (Situation, Background, Assessment, Recommendation) formats. STAR is typically preferred for interview questions about your experiences, while SBAR is more often used in clinical communication. Using STAR to structure your answers in interviews usually works well!\n\nRegarding your request for a two-weeks’ notice email template: I’m here to support you with your application and questions about nursing roles at Riverside, so I’m not able to provide templates or draft personal messages.

                "output": "Great questions! The Nurse Manager interview at Riverside is usually a 1:1 conversation, but occasionally there may be one additional team member present.

For your interview prep, using the STAR format (Situation, Task, Action, Result) is definitely a good approach—most interviewers here appreciate clear, structured answers when you’re describing past experiences.

Taking breaks, getting fresh air, and even just stepping away for a few minutes can really help clear your mind. Remember, you’re not alone in this, and it’s okay to feel overwhelmed sometimes.

Breaking study sessions into shorter chunks and reviewing right before a quick rest can also help things stick. And don’t forget to be kind to yourself—rest is just as important as study time. 😊\n\nIf you want to continue with the RN application or have more questions about the job, I’m here for you!"

Sometimes, just reminding yourself why you’re working so hard—like your passion for nursing or your goals—can help push through those tired moments. And honestly, sometimes a short nap is exactly what your brain needs to recharge!\n\nIf you’d like to get back to the RN application or have questions about the role, I’m here for you whenever you’re ready."

Many nurses and students experience this, especially when they’re balancing work and study. Rest is actually important for memory and learning, so don’t be too hard on yourself if it happens. Sometimes, a quick nap can help you come back feeling more refreshed and ready to focus. 😊\n\nIf you’d like to continue with the RN application or have any questions about the job, just let me know—I’m here to help!"
